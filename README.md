# learn-raylib

##Motivation for repository
I will be using the repository to store small projects relating to graphics using Raylib. Most of the projects I intend to add here will be games.

##Notes 
A big thank you to educ8s for his raylib template for VSCode, which helped me get this up and running initially.
